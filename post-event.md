The schedule did not change nor did it run over. The event went as planned and thought during the planning phrase. 
As planned, we had three campus experts (myself, @salimcodes and @kromate) on the call and the call was moderated by a member of the society.

We got the feed from comments made on the community's online platform. 

## Any difficulty from attendees obtaining the GitHub Student Developer Pack?

We shared the URL and none of the attendees reported any issues with the GitHub Student Developer Pack. By virtue of the fact that the GitHub Student Developer Pack is a prerequisite for applications for the GitHub Campus Experts program, members of the community (i.e. attendees) were receptive of the pack.

## Summary :thought_balloon:

*Please answer the following questions to provide your personal overview of the event:*
At this event, I learned the importance of tailoring the information to the specific interests and backgrounds 
of the attendees, as their engagement and understanding improved significantly when the subject was relatable. 
If another Campus Expert plans to organize a similar event, I would recommend focusing more interactive elements, such as a Q&A segment or group 
activities, could boost engagement and make the session more dynamic. Additionally, providing attendees with a clear follow-up plan, 
like resources or steps they could take after the event, would also enhance the overall impact. After the session, 
several attendees approached me to discuss the GitHub Campus Experts program in more detail, and their questions 
reflected a genuine interest in becoming involved. I gathered that the community has a mix of curiosity and enthusiasm, 
particularly among those who are exploring how to grow their skills, contribute more actively and apply to the GitHub 
Campus Expert program. The discussions gave me the impression that, although many are interested, some lack the confidence 
or direction to take the first steps with their applications, highlighting the need for ongoing mentorship and encouragement within the community.
